# Logic Gate Simulator

A project created in 24 hours for HackUO

This project is a game/simulator/digital toybox that provides logic gates and the ability to connect them.
It includes all the basic logic gates (not, and, or, xor, etc)

The "new" button allows for creating custom components, though the way it works is rather unpolished/annoying
Specifically, it orders inputs and outputs based on the order that buttons/lights were placed in the world

To select a different output when building wires, use the number buttons

Libraries used:
-Monogame framework
-Apos input
-Myra UI
